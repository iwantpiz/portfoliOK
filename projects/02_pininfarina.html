                <p>Collaborating with Pininfarina, I brought their digital project to life by creating a user-centric online shop. </p>

                <p>The goal was to design a simple yet elegant shopping experience that highlights the exceptional quality of their products. 
                  Our successful collaboration led to a shop that achieved immediate success, with sales extending to the USA.</p>
