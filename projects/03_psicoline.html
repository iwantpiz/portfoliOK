            <p>The goal was to create an accessible, user-friendly MVP that offers a more private, comfortable alternative to traditional online services, simplifying the process of seeking help.
          </p>
          <p>This project is of great significance to me, as I had the privilege of overseeing every phase—from initial research to final testing. 
            This comprehensive involvement presented a substantial challenge, which I successfully navigated to completion.
            In this project, I applied a holistic approach to product design, ensuring that every element was intuitive and met user needs. 
            My experience allowed me to integrate user-centered design principles, ensuring that the final product was not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and accessible.</p>

          <p><span class="bold">Key Objectives:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a convenient alternative to traditional face-to-face psychological consultations.</li>
            <li>Offer a private and comfortable environment for women to discuss their problems.</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </li>
            <li>Simplify and streamline the process of seeking psychological help.</li>

        <p>Based on the User Journey and Card Sorting results, a User Flow was created to outline the steps Marta would take while using the app. 
          To ensure an app that genuinely empowers women seeking psychological support, I started with low-fidelity wireframes. 
          I then conducted a detailed survey to gather user feedback on the app’s layout, design, and functionality. 
          Analyzing these survey results provided critical insights, allowing me to refine the design to better meet the needs and preferences of my target audience. 
          This iterative process ensured that the final product is both user-friendly and effective.⁤</p>
