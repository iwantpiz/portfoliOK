          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Psicoline is a concept for an app designed for women who lack the time or resources to attend in-person consultations, or who feel embarrassed discussing their issues in front of strangers.
          </p>

          <h4>Problem</h4>
          <p>
            Psicoline stems from the need to create a familiar yet professional space for women going through difficult times. It allows them to comfortably discuss their issues, regardless of their location or available communication means, without having to sacrifice work or childcare.
          </p>

          <h4>Solution</h4>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Provide a convenient alternative to traditional face-to-face psychological consultations.</li>
              <li>Offer a private and comfortable environment for women to discuss their problems.</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </li>
              <li>Simplify and streamline the process of seeking psychological help.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>An in-depth analysis of existing online psychological services and apps available in Spanish was conducted. 
          This analysis aimed to identify their strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the market.

        <p> Based on the User Journey and Card Sorting results, a User Flow was created to outline the steps Marta would take while using the app. 
            To ensure an app that genuinely empowers women seeking psychological support, I started with low-fidelity wireframes. 
            I then conducted a detailed survey to gather user feedback on the app’s layout, design, and functionality.  
        ⁤</p>
        <p>Analyzing these survey results allowed me to refine the design to better meet the needs and preferences of my target audience. 
        ⁤</p>
          
          <p><span class="bold">Market requirements:</span>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="bold">Emotional support through design:</span> creating a safe, supportive environment.<br>
                <span class="bold">UI/UX solution:</span> create an emotionally supportive interface using soft calming colors and visuals that create feelings of calm and harmony.
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Simplified access:</span> for women who face logistical barriers could benefit from easily accessible self-help resources.<br>
                <span class="bold">UI/UX solution:</span> provide immediate access to custom resources, exercises, and practices to empower users to take control of their mental health.
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Personalized UX:</span> tailoring content and consultations to the user's specific needs to enhance engagement and retention.<br>
                <span class="bold">UI/UX solution:</span> personalize the experience, recommending content and therapists based on user preferences, previous interactions, or mental health goals.
              </li>
              <li><span class="bold">Mobile-First Design:</span> many users may rely on smartphones as their primary device for accessing online services.<br>
                <span class="bold">UI/UX solution:</span> focus on a mobile-first design that is responsive, intuitive, and optimized for smaller screens.
              </li>
            </ul>            
          </p>
          <p>In conclusion, the design was driven by a user-centred approach, combining aesthetics and functionality to create an intuitive and engaging experience. 
            Through careful research and iteration, I developed an interface that not only meets users' needs, but anticipates them, offering accessible and immediate support.
